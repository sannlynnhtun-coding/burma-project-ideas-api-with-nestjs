## Common Issues and Fixes

### PowerShell Execution Policy Error

If you encounter an error similar to the one below when executing scripts in PowerShell:

```
ng : File C:\Users\d\AppData\Roaming\npm\ng.ps1 cannot be loaded
```

This error occurs because your system's PowerShell is not configured to allow the execution of scripts by default. This issue is particularly common on Windows 10, especially when using Visual Studio Code with PowerShell as the default terminal.

#### How to Fix

You can resolve this issue by running the following command in the PowerShell terminal:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Useful Commands

### Creating a Controller in NestJS

To generate a controller in your NestJS application without creating a separate folder, use the command:

```bash
nest g co [controller name]
```

Simply replace `[controller name]` with the desired name for your controller.

### Running the NestJS Application in Development Mode

To start your NestJS application in development mode with automatic file watching, run:

```bash
npm run start:dev --watch
```

This command ensures that your server restarts automatically whenever changes are detected.
